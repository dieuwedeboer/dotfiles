# Dieuwe's Dotfiles

More than just dotfiles - repeatable system setups.

Useful environment configuration for various applications.

## Installation

See ansible directory for new installation steps.

Ansible will run `chezmoi apply` and put all the dotfiles in place.

## Todo

* Finish shift to ansible with variable docroot (`~/src` is hardcoded).
* Tweak fish to show git remote.
* Keep `.emacs.d` clean and re-theme for terminal.
* Install/update lando.
* Include bits of GNOME config and theme.

## Further inspiration

I want to go through a lot of David Wilson's (System Crafters) Emacs
config for more gems and other productivity tools that I will find
