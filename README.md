# Dieuwe's Dotfiles

More than just dotfiles - repeatable system setups.

Useful environment configuration for various applications.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:dieuwedeboer/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
## TODO

* Finish shift to ansible.
* Tweak fish to show directory and git remotes.
* Once again symlink dotfiles rather than copying them.
* Eglot (PHP/TS) and Aidermacs out-of-the-box.
* Keep `.emacs.d` clean and re-theme for terminal.
* Install/update lando.
* Include GNOME top bar config.
* Decide how to handle tmuxinator privately.

## Further inspiration

I want to go through a lot of David Wilson's (System Crafters) Emacs
config for more gems and other productivity tools that I will find
